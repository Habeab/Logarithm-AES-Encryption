# Logarithm AES encryption
### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) has become the encryption algorithm of choice for governments, financial institutions, and security-conscious enterprises around the world.
### The U.S. National Security Agency (NSC) uses it to protect the country’s “top secret” information.

### The AES algorithm successively applies a series of mathematical transformations to each 128-bit block of data.
### Because the computational requirements of this approach are low, AES can be used with consumer computing devices such as laptops and smartphones, as well as for quickly encrypting large amounts of data.
### For example, the IBM z14 mainframe series uses AES to enable pervasive encryption in which all the data in the entire system, whether at rest or in transit, is encrypted.

### AES is a symmetric algorithm which uses the same 128, 192, or 256 bit key for both encryption and decryption (the security of an AES system increases exponentially with key length).
### With even a 128-bit key, the task of cracking AES by checking each of the 2128 possible key values (a “brute force” attack) is so computationally intensive that even the fastest supercomputer would require, on average, more than 100 trillion years to do it.
### In fact, AES has never been cracked, and based on current technological trends, is expected to remain secure for years to come.
